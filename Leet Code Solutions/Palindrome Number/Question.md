# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a <b><i>palindrome</i></b>, and false otherwise.

 
<br><br>
<u>Example 1</u>:<br> 
Input: x = 121<BR>
Output: true<BR>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.<BR><BR>
  

<u>Example 2</u>:<BR>
Input: x = -121<BR>
Output: false<BR>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<BR><BR>
  

<u>Example 3</u>:<BR>
Input: x = 10<BR>
Output: false<BR>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<BR><BR>
